# Planetary-Tourism-Office-Solar-System-Explorer
The Planetary Tourism Office Solar System Explorer is a web application that allows users to plan and customize their interplanetary travel experiences within our solar system. This project provides a user-friendly interface for selecting destinations, spacecraft options, and stay durations at each location.

Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time to incorporate the displayed itinerary for the user, but will hopefully be able to add that at a later date.
